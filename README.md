## Overview

### The challenge

This is a great small challenge to help get you used to building to a design. There's no JS in this project, so you'll be able to focus on your HTML & CSS skills.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

In this project, I practiced using Flexbox for layout and CSS custom properties for better maintainability. I also focused on making the component responsive and accessible.

```html
<h2>Get <span>insights</span> that help your business grow.</h2>
```

I learned that using semantic HTML elements and CSS variables can greatly improve the readability and maintainability of the code.

### Continued Development

I plan to continue improving my skills in responsive design and accessibility. I will also explore using CSS Grid for more complex layouts in future projects.
